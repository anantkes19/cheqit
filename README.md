# Cheqit

This program is my second Android Application, this time as the sole developer created during a one month course at Colby College. The app helps a user record all transactions that occur by recording location, amount, account used to pay, a photo of the transaction and more. The user can view spending data which is pulled from the list of transactions to see data trends like how often they used certain money accounts, where they spend a majority of their money and how much money they spend in a month.
